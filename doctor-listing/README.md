## Manual Testing Guide
- Type in the search bar for suggestions (top 3)
- Select a suggestion or press Enter to filter the doctor list
- Use the filter panel to filter by consultation type, specialties, and sort
- All filters/search/sort work together
- URL updates with query params for all filters/search/sort
- Use browser back/forward to see filters persist
- Inspect elements for correct `data-testid` attributes
- **Sidebar remains fixed and accessible while scrolling**
- **Doctor cards animate in/out on filter/search/sort changes**

---

## Best Practices Followed
- All state and logic managed at the top level (App.jsx)
- All filtering/search/sort is client-side after initial API call
- All interactive/display elements use the exact `data-testid` attributes
- Accessibility: aria-labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- PropTypes for component prop validation
- JSDoc comments for key functions/components
- Linting and formatting with ESLint/Prettier
- Minimal, modern, and maintainable code structure
- **Consistent, theme-based styling and spacing**
- **Motion effects for a modern, dynamic UI**
